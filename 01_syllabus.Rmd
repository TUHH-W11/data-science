## DS101 – Using R for Business Analytics

Spring 2020

Location: Building Q
Time: Monday 09:00-15:00

Instructor: 

* Prof. Christoph Ihl [christoph.ihl@tuhh.de](christoph.ihl@tuhh.de)
* Joschka Schwarz [joschka.schwarz@tuhh.de](joschka.schwarz@tuhh.de)

### General Course Description and Objectives

Practical and skill-focused introduction to using open-source programming software (R, R-studio, and R Markdown) in several aspects of Psychological Research. Course covers basic scripting/coding in R, data-wrangling, advanced graphing and data animation, using R for creating reproducible manuscripts, slide presentations, websites, and web-books for communicating research.

Special Prerequisites: NONE

*Course objectives**: in this course you will learn:

1.	Basic scripting in R: use of variables, logic, loops, functions, intrinsics, packages, workspaces 
2.	Data transformation: processing data-files into a desired form for a desired analysis
3.	Data visualization: advanced plotting and graphing of data, creation of journal-quality figures in R.
4.	Data Simulation: how to create statistical models of data sets for advanced sample-size planning, as well as evaluating existing findings in the literature.
5.	Communicating research: how to use R Markdown scripts to create APA style manuscripts, websites, web-books, and web-based presentations for communicating research.
6.	Reproducible research: principles of open-science, including tools for data-sharing, manuscript sharing, pre-registration of research designs, method-sharing, pre-print sharing, and use of online repository services for disseminating shared materials.

### Course Structure

We meet once per week in a computer lab. Each class will involve a small amount of lecturing on R concepts, and a large amount of time for students to complete coding and analysis problems assigned on a weekly basis. By completing the assignments, students will create a coding portfolio demonstrating a variety of data-analysis and communication skills. The process of learning to code is one that involves patience, time, and practice. Students are expected to practice coding outside of class time each week.


### Lecture Schedule

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
lectures <- read_excel("Schedule.xlsx", sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL, na = "", skip = 0)
lectures[is.na(lectures)]<- " "
knitr::kable(lectures)
```


### Assignments and Grading

There are 8 weekly assignments, a midterm project, and a final project composed of an in-class presentation and a paper. The grading rubric is below:

| Assignment |  Points| Total|
|:----------|--------:|-------:|
| Weekly assignments | 7 | 56|
| Midterm project | 17 | 17 |
| Final Presentation | 7| 7|
| Final Paper | 20 | 20|
