# **DATA SCIENCE**

### *Module from our certificate program* {style="padding-top: 0px;"}

#### Overview

Data Science is the science of extracting knowledge and information from data and requires competencies in both statistical and computer-based data analysis. This module is part of our complementary studies which are supposed to familiarize students with the entrepreneurial challenges of the future and expand their knowledge on important aspects of technology management.

This is a class for programming with R. It will teach you how to program in R, with hands-on examples. I wrote it for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. You’ll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R’s programming tools. Throughout the book, you’ll use your newfound skills to solve practical data science problems.


#### Who should take this class?

Students with a strong interest and motivation in acquiring the skills required for mastering the computational aspects of modern business analytics. The class is mainly targeting ...  


```{r r-import, echo=FALSE}

## DS101 – Using R for Business Analytics

Spring 2020

Location: Building Q
Time: Monday 09:00-15:00

Instructor: 

* Prof. Christoph Ihl [christoph.ihl@tuhh.de](christoph.ihl@tuhh.de)
* Joschka Schwarz [joschka.schwarz@tuhh.de](joschka.schwarz@tuhh.de)

### General Course Description and Objectives

Practical and skill-focused introduction to using open-source programming software (R, R-studio, and R Markdown) in several aspects of Psychological Research. Course covers basic scripting/coding in R, data-wrangling, advanced graphing and data animation, using R for creating reproducible manuscripts, slide presentations, websites, and web-books for communicating research.

Special Prerequisites: NONE

**Course objectives**: in this course you will learn:

1.	Basic scripting in R: use of variables, logic, loops, functions, intrinsics, packages, workspaces 
2.	Data transformation: processing data-files into a desired form for a desired analysis
3.	Data visualization: advanced plotting and graphing of data, creation of journal-quality figures in R.
4.	Data Simulation: how to create statistical models of data sets for advanced sample-size planning, as well as evaluating existing findings in the literature.
5.	Communicating research: how to use R Markdown scripts to create APA style manuscripts, websites, web-books, and web-based presentations for communicating research.
6.	Reproducible research: principles of open-science, including tools for data-sharing, manuscript sharing, pre-registration of research designs, method-sharing, pre-print sharing, and use of online repository services for disseminating shared materials.

### Course Structure

We meet once per week in a computer lab. Each class will involve a small amount of lecturing on R concepts, and a large amount of time for students to complete coding and analysis problems assigned on a weekly basis. By completing the assignments, students will create a coding portfolio demonstrating a variety of data-analysis and communication skills. The process of learning to code is one that involves patience, time, and practice. Students are expected to practice coding outside of class time each week.


### Lecture Schedule

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
lectures <- read_excel("Schedule.xlsx", sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL, na = "", skip = 0)
knitr::kable(lectures)
```


### Assignments and Grading

There are 8 weekly assignments, a midterm project, and a final project composed of an in-class presentation and a paper. The grading rubric is below:

| Assignment |  Points| Total|
|:----------|--------:|-------:|
| Weekly assignments | 7 | 56|
| Midterm project | 17 | 17 |
| Final Presentation | 7| 7|
| Final Paper | 20 | 20|

We will be spending the first few weeks of the course working on solving different kinds of business problems in R. These problems will help you learn the ins and outs of coding in R. You can get a head start by trying to solve the problems in this [list of programming challenges](https://crumplab.github.io/programmingforpsych/programming-challenges-i-learning-the-fundamentals.html). 

# Session

## R & RStudio

You can add more headers by adding more hashtags. These won't be put into the table of contents

### third level header

Here's an even lower level header

I'm writing this tutorial going from the top down. And, this is how it will be printed. So, notice the second post is second in the list. If you want your most recent post to be at the top, then make a new post starting at the top. If you want the oldest first, do, then keep adding to the bottom

# Session
## Second level

So far this is just a blog where you can write in plain text and serve your writing to a webpage. One of the main purposes of this lab journal is to record your progress learning R. The reason I am asking you to use this process is because you can both make a website, and a lab journal, and learn R all in R-studio. This makes everything really convenient and in the sam place. 

So, let's say you are learning how to make a histogram in R. For example, maybe you want to sample 100 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 0, and standard deviation =1, and then you want to plot a histogram. You can do this right here by using an r code block, like this:

```{r}
samples <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)
hist(samples)
```

When you knit this R Markdown document, you will see that the histogram is printed to the page, along with the R code. This document can be set up to hide the R code in the webpage, just delete the comment (hashtag), from the cold folding option in the yaml header up top. For purposes of letting yourself see the code, and me see the code, best to keep it the way that it is. You learn all of these things and more can be customized in each R code block.

# Session
## Second level

Use this lab journal to record what you do in R. This way I will be able to see what you are doing and help you along the way. You will also be creating a repository of all the things you do. You can make posts about everything. Learning specific things in R (project unrelated), and doing things for the project that we will discuss at the beginning of the Fall semester. You can get started now by fiddling around with googling things, and trying stuff out in R. I've placed some helpful starting links in the links page on this website

# Shiny Test

# Resources
### R and R-Studio

[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a free open-source programming language that can be used for statistical analysis, data-simulation, graphing, and lots of other stuff. Another free program is [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com), that provides a nice graphic interface for R. Download R first, then download R-studio. Both can run on PCs, Macs or Linux. Students will be learning R in the stats labs using the lab manual []().

### Additional R resources

1. Google is great, Google your problem
2. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is great, google will often take you there because someone has already asked your question, and someone else has answered, usually many people have answered your question many ways.
3. This is the definitive guide for all things R Markdown (you will find this very useful as you get better at this skill): [https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
