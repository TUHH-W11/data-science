```

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages developed by RStudio’s chief scientist Hadley Wickham. These packages work well together as part of larger data analysis pipeline. To learn more about these tools and how they work together, read R for data science.

The following tutorial will introduce some basic functions in tidyverse for structuring and analyzing datasets. This is the first in a three-part series on cleaning data to visualize it in R using the tidyverse.

## Introduction to Pipes
<a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org">
<img src="input/session_01/01_images/logo_pipe.svg" align="right" style="width:250px; height:250px; padding:10px"/>
</a>
You will be using the “pipe”-operator `%>%` throughout this class. The “pipe” is from the `magrittr` package. Read about using it <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. It makes your code more readable by structuring sequences of data operations left-to-right (as opposed to from the inside and out). The pipe makes your code read more like a sentence, branching from left to right. Mathematically it can be written like the following:

* `x %>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)`
* `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`
* `x %>% f %>% g %>% h` is equivalent to `h(g(f(x)))`


Instead of writing this:

```
data <- iris
data <- head(data, n=3)
```

you can write the code like this:

``` r
# The easiest way to get magrittr is to load the whole tidyverse:
library("tidyverse")
# Alternatively, load just magrittr:
library("magrittr")

iris %>% head(n=3)
```

## Tibbles
<a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org/">
<img src="input/session_01/01_images/logo_tibble.svg" align="right" style="width:250px; height:250px; padding:10px"/>
</a>

* tibble is one of the unifying features of tidyverse,
* it is a better data.frame realization,
* objects data.frame can be coerced to tibble using as_tibble()

When you print a tibble:
* all columns that fit the screen are shown,
* first 10 rows are shown,
* data type for each column is shown.

```
 tibble(
    x = 1,          # recycling
    y = runif(50), 
    z = x + y^2,
    outcome = rnorm(50)
  )
```

```
as_tibble(cars)
```

Subsetting tibbles

```
vehicles <- as_tibble(cars[1:5,])
vehicles[['speed']]
vehicles[[1]]
vehicles$speed
# Using placeholders
vehicles %>% .$dist
vehicles %>% .[['dist']]
vehicles %>% .[[2]]
```

## Loading data with readr
<a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org">
<img src="input/session_01/01_images/logo_readr.svg" align="right" style="width:250px; height:250px; padding:10px"/>
</a>
In tidyverse you import data using readr package that provides a number of useful data import functions:

read_csv() used to read comma-delimited files,

The most commonly used read_csv() has some familiar arguments like:

skip -- to specify the number of rows to skip (headers),
col_names -- to supply a vector of column names,
comment -- to specify what character designates a comment,
na -- to specify how missing values are represented.

```r
# Loading data
dataset_tbl <- read_csv("data.csv"))

# Writing data
write_csv(dataset_tbl, "data.csv")
```

But saving in csv (or tsv) does mean you loose information about the type of data in particular columns. You can avoid this by using:

write_rds() and read_rds() to read/write objects in R binary rds format,

## Reshaping your data with tidyr
<a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/">
<img src="input/session_01/01_images/logo_tidyr.svg" align="right" style="width:250px; height:250px; padding:10px"/>
</a>

The Concept of Tidy Data

* each and every observation is represented as exactly one row,
* each and every variable is represented by exactly one column,
* thus each data table cell contains only one value.

```{r tidy-data, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The concept of tidy data', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('input/session_01/01_images/tidy_data.png', dpi = NA)
```

Usually data are untidy in only one way. However, if you are unlucky, they are really untidy and thus a pain to work with...

For the following example is the Diamonds Dataset used from the ggplot2 package.

`gather`: Use, if some of your column names are actually values of a variable

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
diamonds2 <- readRDS("input/session_01/02_R/diamonds2.rds")
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
diamonds2

diamonds2 %>% 
  gather(`2008`, `2009`, key = 'year', value = 'price')
```

`spread`: Use, if some of your observations are scattered across many rows
```r
bijou3
```
```r
bijou3 %>% 
  spread(key=dimension, value=measurement) %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

## Data Transformations with dplyr
<a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">
<img src="input/session_01/01_images/logo_dplyr.svg" align="right" style="width:250px; height:250px; padding:10px"/>

#  `r fa("user-tie", fill = "black")` Business case - Sales Analysis

<font size="4">Sales Analysis Overview</font>

**Overall goals**

Introductory words ... You are a data scientist. Your assignment is to ...

* study the products ...
* looking for opportunities to sell new producgts
* better serve the customer
* better market the products

* justify it by data ...

**Goals for this session** 

* Get your hands into R with a real world situation
* Analyze Sales over time of products sold through the Olist Store
    + Sales by Year
    + Sales by secondary product category
  
**Steps**

1. Import
    + flatfiles
    + databases
    + scrape
2. Wrangle data
    + examine data
    + clean data
    + join data
3. Visualize data

**Context**
Olist is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on their website: [www.olist.com](www.olist.com)

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

```{r olist-example-page, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Project structure example in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('input/session_01/01_images/olist_example_page.png', dpi = NA)
```


## Theory / Background
### Transactional data

```{r transactional-data, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Project structure example in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('input/session_01/01_images/transactional_data.png', dpi = NA)
```
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Types of database relationships (1-to-1, 1-to-many,many-to-many)



### data schema

The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization. Please refer to the following data schema when working with it:

```{r olist-structure-01, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Project structure example in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('input/session_01/01_images/olist_structure_01.png', dpi = NA)
```

* insert explanation and screenshots of the excel files

The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. In addition a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates is released.

This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

**Attention**

1. An order might have multiple items.
2. Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.
3. All text identifying stores and partners where replaced by the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

It was also a Marketing Funnel Dataset released. Both datasets may be joined to see an order from Marketing perspective!

```{r olist-structure-02, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Project structure example in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('input/session_01/01_images/olist_structure_02.png', dpi = NA)
```

**Inspiration**

Here are some inspiration for possible outcomes from this dataset.

NLP: 

This dataset offers a supreme environment to parse out the reviews text through its multiple dimensions.

Clustering:

Some customers didn't write a review. But why are they happy or mad?

Sales Prediction:

With purchase date information you'll be able to predict future sales.

Delivery Performance:

You will also be able to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimize delivery times.

Product Quality: 

Enjoy yourself discovering the products categories that are more prone to customer insatisfaction.

Feature Engineering: 

Create features from this rich dataset or attach some external public information to it.

#   1. Coming up with a new product idea, and 
# 
# 2. Segmenting the customer-base
# 
# # Objectives
# 
# 1. Apply `dplyr` and `tidyr` functions to answer questions related to the course projects. 
# 
# 2. Gain exposure to `rmarkdown`
# 
# # Data
# 
# To read the data, make sure that the paths point to the appropriate data sets. Saving the file in the main directory should enable the paths to be detected correctly. 
#

# 
# # Questions
# 
# 
# 
# ## 1. What are the unique categories of products? (Difficulty = Low)
# 
# - Begin with `bike_orderlines_tbl`
# - Use `distinct()` to evaluate 
# 
# Review Primary Product Category (`category_1`).
# 
# ```{r}
# 
# ```
# 
# 
# Review Secondary Product Category (`category_2`).
# 
# ```{r}
# 
# ```
# 
# Review Frame Material (`frame_material`).
# 
# ```{r}
# 
# ```
# 
# 
# ## 2. Which product categories have the most sales? (Difficulty = Medium)
# 
# - Select appropriate columns from `bike_orderlines_tbl`
# - Group and summarize the data calling the new column `Sales`. Make sure to ungroup. 
# - Arrange descending by `Sales`
# - Rename column names to `Primary Category`, `Secondary Category`, or `Frame Material` (as appropriate).
# - Format the Sales as `dollar()` 
# 
# Review Primary Product Category (`category_1`).
# 
# ```{r}
#
