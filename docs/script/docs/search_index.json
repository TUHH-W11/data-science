It will teach you how to program in R, with hands-on examples for business analytics. It is written for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. You’ll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R’s programming tools. "],
["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface Ziel des scripts This book will teach you how to program in R. You’ll go from loading data to writing your own functions (which will outperform the functions of other R users). But this is not a typical introduction to R. I want to help you become a data scientist, as well as a computer scientist, so this book will focus on the programming skills that are most related to data science. ##Aufbau## The chapters in the book are arranged according to three practical projects–given that they’re fairly substantial projects, they span multiple chapters. I chose these projects for two reasons. First, they cover the breadth of the R language. You will learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R’s programming tools, such as if else statements, for loops, S3 classes, R’s package system, and R’s debugging tools. The projects will also teach you how to write vectorized R code, a style of lightning-fast code that takes advantage of all of the things R does best. But, more importantly, the projects will teach you how to solve the logistical problems of data science—and there are many logistical problems. When you work with data, you will need to store, retrieve, and manipulate large sets of values without introducing errors. As you work through the book, I will teach you not just how to program with R, but how to use the programming skills to support your work as a data scientist. Is made of projects … As you complete them, you will become an expert at the skills you need to work with data as a data scientist. You will learn how to store data in your computer’s memory, how to access data that is already there, and how to transform data values in memory when necessary. You will also learn how to write your own programs in R that you can use to analyze data and run simulations. ##Audience## Not every programmer needs to be a data scientist, so not every programmer will find this book useful. You will find this book helpful if you’re in one of the following categories: You already use R as a statistical tool, but you would like to learn how to write your own functions and simulations with R. You would like to teach yourself how to program, and you see the sense of learning a language related to data science. There is no prerequisite knowledge needed in R Programming, Data Science, or Machine Learning. I have written it for beginning programmers. I do not talk about the theory of computer science—there are no discussions of big O() and little o() in these pages. Nor do I get into advanced details such as the workings of lazy evaluation. These things are interesting if you think of computer science at the theoretical level, but they are a distraction when you first learn to program. Instead, I teach you how to program in R with three concrete examples. These examples are short, easy to understand, and cover everything you need to know. As a teacher, I have found that students learn abstract concepts much faster when they are illustrated by concrete examples. The examples have a second advantage, as well: they provide immediate practice. Learning to program is like learning to speak another language—you progress faster when you practice. In fact, learning to program is learning to speak another language. You will get the best results if you follow along with the examples in the book and experiment whenever an idea strikes you. ##Business Bezug## One of the biggest surprises in this book is that I do not cover traditional applications of R, such as models and graphs; instead, I treat R purely as a programming language. Why this narrow focus? R is designed to be a tool that helps scientists analyze data. It has many excellent functions that make plots and fit models to data. As a result, many statisticians learn to use R as if it were a piece of software—they learn which functions do what they want, and they ignore the rest. Visualizing and modeling data are complicated skills that require a scientist’s full attention. It takes expertise, judgement, and focus to extract reliable insights from a data set. I would not recommend that any data scientist distract herself with computer programming until she feels comfortable with the basic theory and practice of her craft. If you would like to learn the craft of data science, I recommend the book R for Data Science, my companion volume to this book, co-written with Hadley Wickham. The book is a companion to R for Data Science. In that book, Hadley Wickham and I explain how to use R to make plots, model data, and write reports. That book teaches these tasks as data-science skills, which require judgement and expertise—not as programming exercises, which they also are. This book will teach you how to program in R. It does not assume that you have mastered the data-science skills taught in R for Data Science (nor that you ever intend to). However, this skill set amplifies that one. And if you master both, you will be a powerful, computer-augmented data scientist, fit to command a high salary and influence scientific dialogue. "],
["introduction-to-r.html", "0.1 Introduction to R", " 0.1 Introduction to R 0.1.1 What is R? R is a powerful statistical environment and programming language for the analysis and visualization of data … 0.1.2 Why using R? Complete statistical environment and programming language Efficient functions and data structures for data analysis Powerful graphics Access to fast growing number of analysis packages Technical advantages: free, open-source, available for all OSs It’s easy to get distracted by Tableau and PowerBI’s visuals, but when it comes to making business decisions, your organization needs to be able to take actions. This is where R Shiny is lightyears ahead of the other tools - R Shiny is a powerful ecosystem for business + data science + apps. However, learning to program should be on every data scientist’s to-do list. Knowing how to program will make you a more flexible analyst and augment your mastery of data science in every way. My favorite metaphor for describing this was introduced by Greg Snow on the R help mailing list in May 2006. Using functions in R is like riding a bus. Writing functions in R is like driving a car. Busses are very easy to use, you just need to know which bus to get on, where to get on, and where to get off (and you need to pay your fare). Cars, on the other hand, require much more work: you need to have some type of map or directions (even if the map is in your head), you need to put gas in every now and then, you need to know the rules of the road (have some type of drivers license). The big advantage of the car is that it can take you a bunch of places that the bus does not go and it is quicker for some trips that would require transferring between busses. Using this analogy, programs like SPSS are busses, easy to use for the standard things, but very frustrating if you want to do something that is not already preprogrammed. R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a kayak on top, good walking and running shoes in the passenger seat, and mountain climbing and spelunking gear in the back. R can take you anywhere you want to go if you take time to learn how to use the equipment, but that is going to take longer than learning where the bus stops are in SPSS. - Greg Snow Greg compares R to SPSS, but he assumes that you use the full powers of R; in other words, that you learn how to program in R. If you only use functions that preexist in R, you are using R like SPSS: it is a bus that can only take you to certain places. This flexibility matters to data scientists. The exact details of a method or simulation will change from problem to problem. If you cannot build a method tailored to your situation, you may find yourself tempted to make unrealistic assumptions just so you can use an ill-suited method that already exists. This book will help you make the leap from bus to car. further stuff R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good thing The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that’s a good thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again. Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes. Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use. R code is great for reproducibility Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis. R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically. An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements. R is interdisciplinary and extensible With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more. R works on data of all shapes and sizes The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you. R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient. R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web. R produces high-quality graphics The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data. R has a large and welcoming community Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as Stack Overflow, or on the RStudio community. Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs. bonus Isn’t R a language? You may hear me speak of R in the third person. For example, I might say, “Tell R to do this” or “Tell R to do that”, but of course R can’t do anything; it is just a language. This way of speaking is shorthand for saying, “Tell your computer to do this by writing a command in the R language at the command line of your RStudio console.” Your computer, and not R, does the actual work. Is this shorthand confusing and slightly lazy to use? Yes. Do a lot of people use it? Everyone I know–probably because it is so convenient. When do we compile? In some languages, like C, Java, and FORTRAN, you have to compile your human-readable code into machine-readable code (often 1s and 0s) before you can run it. If you’ve programmed in such a language before, you may wonder whether you have to compile your R code before you can use it. The answer is no. R is a dynamic programming language, which means R automatically interprets your code as you run it. "],

["working-with-rstudio.html", "1.2 Working with RStudio", " 1.2 Working with RStudio Let’s start by learning about RStudio, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R. We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. (RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during this class). 1.2.1 Understanding the RStudio IDE To get started, open RStudio just as you would open any other application on your computer. When you do, a window should appear in your screen like the one shown in (insert reference) FIGURE 1.1: Project structure example in RStudio. One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and less error-prone. RStudio is divided into 4 Panes. The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Pane Layout). .boxouter { border-radius: 5px; width: 800px; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; } .boxfloat { padding: 10px; border: 5px solid; background-color: #fff; border-radius: 5px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold; float: left; width: 150px; height: 80px; margin: 0 20px 0 0; display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-direction: column; text-align:center; } Script files/ Source Haere are the script files and documents.

Pro Tip To change the appearence of RStudio go to Tools –&gt; Global options –&gt; appearences Pro Tip Change saving to never … 1.2.2 Getting set up It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder, called the working directory. All of the scripts within this folder can then use relative paths to files that indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still work. RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its “Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optionally preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a break. Go through the steps for creating an “R Project” for this tutorial below. Download the zip file, extract the date and and choose a convenient location for it. (e.g. C:/files/data-science/) Download https://desktop.github.com In RStudio under the File menu, click on New Project and then choose Existing Directory. This will be your working directory (e.g., ~/data-science). Locate the downloaded folder and then click Create Project. Tip - Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in RStudio. RStudio’s default preferences generally work well, but saving a workspace to .RData can be cumbersome, especially if you are working with larger datasets. To turn that off, go to Tools –&gt; ‘Global Options’ and select the ‘Never’ option for ‘Save workspace to .RData’ on exit.’ 1.2.2.1 Organizing your working directory Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for scripts, data, and documents. data_raw/ &amp; data/ Use these folders to store raw data and intermediate datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake of transparency and provenance, you should always keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could have files data_raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt and …plot2.txt kept separate from a data/tree.survey.csv file generated by the scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R script. documents/ This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts and other text. scripts/ This would be the location to keep your R scripts for different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your functions (more on that later). Additional (sub)directories depending on your project needs. For this first project, we will just need a getting_started/ folder to store our first script, and we will use data/ for when we learn how to export data as CSV files, and a fig/ folder for the figures that we will save. Under the Files tab on the right of the screen, click on New Folder and create a folder named data_raw within your newly created working directory (e.g., ~/data-carpentry/). (Alternatively, type dir.create(“data_raw”) at your R console.) Repeat these operations to create a data and a fig folder. We are going to keep the script in the root of our working directory because we are only going to use one file and it will make things easier. Your working directory should now look like this: 1.2.2.2 The working directory The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When you write code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to the root of your working directory and only need files within this structure. Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory is set properly. If you need to check it, you can use getwd(). If for some reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser where your working directory should be, and clicking on the blue gear icon “More”, and select “Set As Working Directory”. Alternatively you can use setwd(“/path/to/working/directory”) to reset your working directory. However, your scripts should not include this line because it will fail on someone else’s computer. 1.2.2.3 Interacting with R The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or code, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call the instructions commands and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by executing (also called running) those commands. There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console and press Enter to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session. Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their computer. RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the Ctrl + Enter shortcut (on Macs, Cmd + Return will work, too). The command on the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press Ctrl + Enter. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE. At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of a variable or the structure of an object, without necessarily keeping a record of it in your script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the console. RStudio provides the Ctrl + 1 and Ctrl + 2 shortcuts allow you to jump between the script and the console panes. If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a &gt; prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using Ctrl + Enter), R will try to execute it, and when ready, will show the results and come back with a new &gt; prompt to wait for new commands. If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t complete yet, the console will show a + prompt. It means that you haven’t finished entering a complete command. This is because you have not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don’t have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and press Esc; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the &gt; prompt.

["basic-r-commands-and-syntax.html", "1.3 Basic R commands and syntax", " 1.3 Basic R commands and syntax This chapter provides a broad overview of the R language that will get you programming right away. In it, you will build a pair of virtual dice that you can use to generate random numbers. Don’t worry if you’ve never programmed before; the chapter will teach you everything you need to know. To simulate a pair of dice, you will have to distill each die into its essential features. You cannot place a physical object, like a die, into a computer (well, not without unscrewing some screws), but you can save information about the object in your computer’s memory. Which information should you save? In general, a die has six important pieces of information: when you roll a die, it can only result in one of six numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. You can capture the essential characteristics of a die by saving the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as a group of values in your computer’s memory. Let’s work on saving these numbers first, and then consider a method for “rolling” our die. The RStudio interface is simple. You type R code into the bottom line of the RStudio console pane and then click Enter to run it. The code you type is called a command, because it will command your computer to do something for you. The line you type it into is called the command line. When you type a command at the prompt and hit Enter, your computer executes the command and shows you the results. Then RStudio displays a fresh prompt for your next command. For example, if you type 1 + 1 and hit Enter, RStudio will display: `&gt; 1 + 1 [1] 2 &gt; You’ll notice that a [1] appears next to your result. R is just letting you know that this line begins with the first value in your result. Some commands return more than one value, and their results may fill up multiple lines. For example, the command 100:130 returns 31 values; it creates a sequence of integers from 100 to 130. Notice that new bracketed numbers appear at the start of the second and third lines of output. These numbers just mean that the second line begins with the 14th value in the result, and the third line begins with the 25th value. You can mostly ignore the numbers that appear in brackets: &gt; 100:130 [1] 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 [14] 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 [25] 126 127 128 129 130 Infobox The colon operator (:) returns every integer between two integers. It is an easy way to create a sequence of numbers. If you type an incomplete command and press Enter, R will display a + prompt, which means R is waiting for you to type the rest of your command. Either finish the command or hit Escape to start over: &gt; 5 - + + 1 [1] 4 If you type a command that R doesn’t recognize, R will return an error message. If you ever see an error message, don’t panic. R is just telling you that your computer couldn’t understand or do what you asked it to do. You can then try a different command at the next prompt: &gt; 3 % 5 Error: unexpected input in &quot;3 % 5&quot; &gt; Once you get the hang of the command line, you can easily do anything in R that you would do with a calculator. For example, you could do some basic arithmetic: 2 * 3 ## 6 4 - 1 ## 3 6 / (4 - 1) ## 2 Did you notice something different about this code? I’ve left out the &gt;’s and [1]’s. This will make the code easier to copy and paste if you want to put it in your own console. R treats the hashtag character, #, in a special way; R will not run anything that follows a hashtag on a line. This makes hashtags very useful for adding comments and annotations to your code. Humans will be able to read the comments, but your computer will pass over them. The hashtag is known as the commenting symbol in R. For the remainder of the book, I’ll use hashtags to display the output of R code. I’ll use a single hashtag to add my own comments and a double hashtag, ##, to display the results of code. I’ll avoid showing &gt;s and [1]s unless I want you to look at them. Info Box Cancelling commands Some R commands may take a long time to run. You can cancel a command once it has begun by pressing ctrl + c. Note that it may also take R a long time to cancel the comma Throughout the book, I’ll put exercises in chunks, like the one above. I’ll follow each exercise with a model answer, like the one below. 1.3.1 Objects The assignment &lt;- operator x &lt;- 10 x &lt;- x + 10 # we can incremenet( build onto) existing objects x X # must be specific /case sensitive Alert box Capitalization R is case-sensitive, so name and Name will refer to different objects: Name &lt;- 1 name &lt;- 0 Name + 1 ## 2 You can name an object in R almost anything you want, but there are a few rules. First, a name cannot start with a number. Second, a name cannot use some special symbols, like ^, !, $, @, +, -, /, or *: Finally, R will overwrite any previous information stored in an object without asking you for permission. So, it is a good idea to not use names that are already taken: Basic maths vector calculation 1.3.2 Functions Example Own function Arguments 1.3.3 Task Economic order quantitiy \\[Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DK}{h}}\\] Calulate the Q where: \\(D = 1000\\) \\(K = 5\\) \\(h = 0.25\\) # get your current working directory getwd() [1] &quot;/Users/bradleyboehmke/Dropbox/Academia/Wake Forest/BAN6003&quot; # set your working directory setwd(&quot;/Users/bradleyboehmke/Dropbox/Academia/Wake Forest&quot;) getwd() [1] &quot;/Users/bradleyboehmke/Dropbox/Academia/Wake Forest&quot; 1.3.4 Packages Installing Packages # install package from CRAN install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Loading packages # load the package to use in the current R session library(&quot;packagename&quot;) # use a particular function within a package without loading the package packagename::functionname The previous section showed you a couple of examples of running R code. Code in the book looks like this: 1 + 2 ## [1] 3 If you run the same code in your local console, it will look like this: &gt; 1 + 2 [1] 3 There are two main differences. In your console, you type after the &gt;, called the prompt; we don’t show the prompt in the book. In the book, output is commented out with #&gt;; in your console it appears directly after your code. These two differences mean that if you’re working with an electronic version of the book, you can easily copy code out of the book and into the console. Throughout the book we use a consistent set of conventions to refer to code: * Functions are in a code font and followed by parentheses, like sum(), or mean(). * Other R objects (like data or function arguments) are in a code font, without parentheses, like flights or x. If we want to make it clear what package an object comes from, we’ll use the package name followed by two colons, like dplyr::mutate(), or nycflights13::flights. This is also valid R code.

These packages work well together as part of larger data analysis pipeline. To learn more about these tools and how they work together, read R for data science.

["import-loading-data-with-readr-readxl.html", "5.1 IMPORT - Loading data with readr / readxl", " 5.1 IMPORT - Loading data with readr / readxl Before you can manipulate data with R, you need to import the data into R’s memory, or build a connection to the data that R can use to access the data remotely. How you import your data will depend on the format of the data. The most common way to store small data sets is as a plain text file. Data may also be stored in a proprietary format associated with a specific piece of software, such as SAS, SPSS, or Microsoft Excel. Data used on the internet is often stored as a JSON or XML file. Large data sets may be stored in a database or a distributed storage system. When you import data into R, R stores the data in your computer’s RAM while you manipulate it. This creates a size limitation: truly big data sets should be stored outside of R in a database or distributed storage system. You can then create a connection to the system that R can use to access the data without bringing the data into your computer’s RAM. The tidyverse offers the following packages for importing data: readr for reading flat files like .csv files readxl for .xls and .xlsx sheets. haven for SPSS, Stata, and SAS data. googledrive to interact with files on Google Drive from R. .column{ float: left; width: 25%; padding: 5px; } .row::after{ content: \"\"; clear: both; display: table; } .column{ float: left; width: 25%; padding: 5px; } .row::after{ content: \"\"; clear: both; display: table; } Click on the images to get more information There are a handful of other packages that are not in the tidyverse, but are tidyverse-adjacent. They are very useful for importing data from other sources: jsonlite for JSON. xml2 for XML. httr for web APIs. rvest for web scraping. DBI for relational databases. To connect to a specific database, you’ll need to pair DBI with a specific backend like RSQLite, RPostgres, or odbc. Learn more at https://db.rstudio.com. Example # Loading data (can also be achieved by clicking on &quot;Import Dataset &gt; From Text (readr)&quot; in the upper right corner) library(readr) dataset_tbl &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;)) # Writing data write_csv(dataset_tbl, &quot;data.csv&quot;) # Saving in csv (or tsv) does mean you loose information about the type of data in particular columns.

["pipes.html", "5.2 Pipes", " 5.2 Pipes Pipes are a powerful tool for clearly expressing a sequence of multiple operations. You will be using the “pipe”-operator %&gt;% throughout this class. The “pipe” is from the magrittr package. The point of the pipe is to help you write code in a way that is easier to read and understand. It makes your code more readable by structuring sequences of data operations left-to-right (as opposed to from the inside and out). The pipe makes your code read more like a sentence, branching from left to right. You can read it as a series of imperative statements: group, then summarise, then filter. As suggested by this reading, a good way to pronounce %&gt;% when reading code is “then”. Mathematically it can be expressed like the following: x %&gt;% f is equivalent to f(x) x %&gt;% f(y) is equivalent to f(x, y) x %&gt;% f %&gt;% g %&gt;% h is equivalent to h(g(f(x))) Instead of writing this: data &lt;- iris data &lt;- head(data, n=3) you can write the code like this: # The easiest way to get magrittr is to load the whole tidyverse: library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) # Alternatively, load just magrittr: library(&quot;magrittr&quot;) iris %&gt;% head(n=3) Example When coupling several function calls with the pipe-operator, the benefit will become more apparent.
