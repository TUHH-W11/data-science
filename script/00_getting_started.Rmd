The first project will be creating a decision tool used in cost accounting. This first project will make it easier to study these things by teaching you the basics of R. The term “R” is used to refer to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it. Your first mission is simple: assemble R code that will calculate the ideal quantity of inventory to order for a given product. Once you have done that, we’ll be calculating ...

In this project, you will learn how to:

* Use the R and RStudio interfaces
* Run R commands
* Create R objects
* Write your own R functions and scripts

Don’t worry if it seems like we cover a lot of ground fast. This project is designed to give you a concise overview of the R language. You will return to many of the concepts we meet here in the next projects, where you will examine the concepts in depth.

Before you can ask your computer to save some numbers, you’ll need to know how to talk to it. RStudio gives you a way to talk to your computer. R gives you a language to speak in. To start you will need to have both R and RStudio installed on your computer before you can use them. R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. Both are free (under the Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3) and easy to download. R is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. On the following sites you'll find information about how to install the language R and the IDE RStudio. You can choose between an interactive and a manual tutorial.

## Working with RStudio

Let’s start by learning about RStudio, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R. We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during this class.

### Understanding the RStudio IDE

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and less error-prone. To get started, open RStudio just as you would open any other application on your computer. When you do, a window should appear in your screen like the one shown in (insert reference). RStudio is divided into 4 Panes. The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (`Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout`). At first startup you will not see an open script as seen in the green frame. You can create one by clicking first on ![](input/00_getting_started/01_images//new_file.png){ width="3.1%" } (new file) and then on ![](input/00_getting_started/01_images//new_r_file.png){ width="3.1%" } (new R script) in the upper left corner. Alternatively you can use the shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> on Windows & Linux. 

```{r rstudio-ide, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Project structure example in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('input/00_getting_started/01_images/rstudio_ide.png', dpi = NA)
```

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or <b>code</b>, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call the instructions <b>commands</b> and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by <b>executing</b> (also called <b>running</b>) those commands. There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using script files.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

}

</style>
<div class="boxouter">
  <div class="boxfloat" style="border-color: #F52602">Console/ Command Line</div>
The console appears in the bottom left panel. Simply put, the Console is where you type commands and visually see the outputs. This is the place where commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately by hitting Enter. The code you type is called a command, because it will command your computer to do something for you. The line you type it into is called the command line. This pane does not save your code. Those commands will be forgotten when you close the session. It only displays the output and the history of commands that have been executed. When you type a command at the prompt and hit Enter, your computer executes the command and shows you the results. If R is ready to accept a new command, RStudio displays a fresh <code>></code> prompt for your next command. For example, if you type 10 * 10 and hit Enter, RStudio will display:
       
<pre><code>> 10 * 10
[1] 100
></code></pre>

You’ll notice that a <code>[1]</code> appears next to your result. R is just letting you know that this line begins with the first value in your result. Some commands return more than one value, and their results may fill up multiple lines. For example, the command <code>1:100</code> returns 100 values; it creates a sequence of integers from 1 to 100. Notice that new bracketed numbers appear at the start of the second and third lines of output. These numbers just mean that the second line begins with the 30th value in the result, and the third line begins with the 59th value and so on. You can mostly ignore the numbers that appear in brackets:

<pre><code>[1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29
[30]  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58
[59]  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87
[88]  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100</code></pre>

If you type an incomplete command and press Enter, R will display a <code>+</code> prompt, which means R is waiting for you to type the rest of your command. This is because you have not closed a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you do not have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. Either finish the command or hit <kbd>`Esc`</kbd> to start over:

<pre><code>> 99 +
+
+ 1
[1] 100</code></pre>
 
If you type a command that R doesn’t recognize, R will return an error message. If you ever see an error message, don’t panic. R is just telling you that your computer couldn’t understand or do what you asked it to do. You can then try a different command at the next prompt:

<pre><code>> 100 % 2
Error: unexpected input in "100 % 2"
></code></pre>

Once you get the hang of the command line, you can easily do anything in R that you would do with a calculator. For example, you could do some basic arithmetic:

<pre><code>2 * 3   
## 6

4 - 1   
## 3

6 / (4 - 1)   
## 2</code></pre>

Did you notice something different about this code? I’ve left out the <code>></code>’s and <code>[1]</code>’s. This will make the code easier to copy and paste if you want to put it in your own console.

R treats the hashtag character, <code>#</code>, in a special way; R will not run anything that follows a hashtag on a line. This makes hashtags very useful for adding comments and annotations to your code. Humans will be able to read the comments, but your computer will pass over them. The hashtag is known as the commenting symbol in R.

For the remainder of the book, I’ll use hashtags to display the output of R code. I’ll use a single hashtag to add my own comments and a double hashtag, <code>##</code>, to display the results of code. I’ll avoid showing <code>></code> and <code>[1]</code> unless I want you to look at them.

</div>
<div class="boxouter">
      <div class="boxfloat" style="border-color: #4EF903">Script files/ Source</div>
Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script. In the source tab you can create a draft of your code as you go by using an R script. An R script is just a plain text file that you save R code in. I strongly encourage you to write and edit all of your R code in a script before you run it in the console. This habit creates a reproducible record of your work. When you’re finished for the day, you can save your script and then use it to rerun your entire analysis the next day. Scripts are also very handy for editing and proofreading your code, and they make a nice copy of your work to share with others. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their computer. To save a script, click <img src="input/00_getting_started/01_images/save.png" alt="save icon" width="3.1%" > or use the shortcut <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> on Windows & Linux.<br>
<br>
RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd> shortcut (on Macs, <kbd>`Cmd`</kbd> + <kbd>`Return`</kbd> will work, too). The command on the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press the shortcut.
</div>
<div class="boxouter">
      <div class="boxfloat" style="border-color: #2332FF">Environment/ History</div>
When you create an object (i.e., dataframes, arrays, values and functions), the object will appear in the index tab Environment. This pane will show you all of the objects you’ve created since opening RStudio. You can see the values for objects with a single value and for those that are longer R will tell you their class. When you have data in your environment that have two dimensions (rows and columns) you may click on them and they will appear in the Source Editor pane like a spreadsheet. Also in this pane is the History tab, where you can see all of the code executed for the session. If you double-click a line or highlight a block of lines and then double-click those, you can send it to the Console (i.e., run them). The history will not be saved if we did not choose to save the environment after a session. The Build Tab will be useful later when you create your own website to hand in your code. We will come back to this shortly.

<div class="boxouter">
      <div class="boxfloat" style="border-color: #AA7942">Misc. Displays</div>
The bottom right panel is the miscellaneous panel containing five separate tabs. The <b>Files</b> tab has a navigable file manager, just like the file system on your operating system. It shows all the files and folders in the default workspace. The <b>Plot</b> tab is where graphics you create will appear. Here we can zoom, export, configure and inspect graphs/figures. The <b>Packages</b> tab shows you the packages that are installed and those that can be installed (more on this later). The <b>Help</b> tab allows you to search the R documentation for help and is where the help appears when you ask for it from the Console. You can just type <code>?function_name</code> or <code>help(function_name)</code> into the console.

### Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder, called the working directory. All of the scripts within this folder can then use relative paths to files that indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still work.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its “Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optionally preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a break. Go through the steps for creating an “R Project” for this tutorial below.

1. Download the zip file, extract the date and and choose a convenient location for it. (e.g. C:/files/data-science/)
```{block, type='rmdblankbox'}
Download
```
```{block, type='rmdattachment'}
**[https://desktop.github.com](lorem.zip)**
```
2. In RStudio under the `File` menu, click on `New Project` and then choose `Existing Directory`. This will be your working directory (e.g., ~/data-science).
3. Locate the downloaded folder and then click `Create Project`.

```{block, type='rmdblankbox'}
Tip - Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in RStudio.
```
```{block, type='rmdprotip'}
RStudio’s default preferences generally work well, but saving a workspace to .RData can be cumbersome, especially if you are working with larger datasets. To turn that off, go to Tools –> ‘Global Options’ and select the ‘Never’ option for ‘Save workspace to .RData’ on exit.’
```

#### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for scripts, data, and documents.

data_raw/ & data/ 
Use these folders to store raw data and intermediate datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake of transparency and provenance, you should always keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could have files data_raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt and ...plot2.txt kept separate from a data/tree.survey.csv file generated by the scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R script.

documents/ 
This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts and other text.

scripts/ 
This would be the location to keep your R scripts for different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your functions (more on that later).
Additional (sub)directories depending on your project needs.

For this first project, we will just need a getting_started/ folder to store our first script, and we will use data/ for when we learn how to export data as CSV files, and a fig/ folder for the figures that we will save.

Under the Files tab on the right of the screen, click on New Folder and create a folder named data_raw within your newly created working directory (e.g., ~/data-carpentry/). (Alternatively, type dir.create("data_raw") at your R console.) Repeat these operations to create a data and a fig folder.
We are going to keep the script in the root of our working directory because we are only going to use one file and it will make things easier.

Your working directory should now look like this:

#### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When you write code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to the root of your working directory and only need files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory is set properly. If you need to check it, you can use getwd(). If for some reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser where your working directory should be, and clicking on the blue gear icon “More”, and select “Set As Working Directory”. Alternatively you can use setwd("/path/to/working/directory") to reset your working directory. However, your scripts should not include this line because it will fail on someone else’s computer.

#### Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or code, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call the instructions commands and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by executing (also called running) those commands.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console and press Enter to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.

Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their computer.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the Ctrl + Enter shortcut (on Macs, Cmd + Return will work, too). The command on the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press Ctrl + Enter. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE.

At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of a variable or the structure of an object, without necessarily keeping a record of it in your script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the console. RStudio provides the Ctrl + 1 and Ctrl + 2 shortcuts allow you to jump between the script and the console panes.

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>), R will try to execute it, and when ready, will show the results and come back with a new `>` prompt to wait for new commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn't complete yet, the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you haven't finished entering a complete command. This is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and press <kbd>`Esc`</kbd>; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.

##  Basic R commands and syntax 

This chapter provides a broad overview of the R language that will get you programming right away. In it, you will build a pair of virtual dice that you can use to generate random numbers. Don’t worry if you’ve never programmed before; the chapter will teach you everything you need to know.

To simulate a pair of dice, you will have to distill each die into its essential features. You cannot place a physical object, like a die, into a computer (well, not without unscrewing some screws), but you can save information about the object in your computer’s memory.

Which information should you save? In general, a die has six important pieces of information: when you roll a die, it can only result in one of six numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. You can capture the essential characteristics of a die by saving the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as a group of values in your computer’s memory.

Let’s work on saving these numbers first, and then consider a method for “rolling” our die.

The RStudio interface is simple. You type R code into the bottom line of the RStudio console pane and then click Enter to run it. The code you type is called a command, because it will command your computer to do something for you. The line you type it into is called the command line.

When you type a command at the prompt and hit Enter, your computer executes the command and shows you the results. Then RStudio displays a fresh prompt for your next command. For example, if you type 1 + 1 and hit Enter, RStudio will display:

````
> 1 + 1
[1] 2
>
```

You’ll notice that a [1] appears next to your result. R is just letting you know that this line begins with the first value in your result. Some commands return more than one value, and their results may fill up multiple lines. For example, the command 100:130 returns 31 values; it creates a sequence of integers from 100 to 130. Notice that new bracketed numbers appear at the start of the second and third lines of output. These numbers just mean that the second line begins with the 14th value in the result, and the third line begins with the 25th value. You can mostly ignore the numbers that appear in brackets:

```
> 100:130
 [1] 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112
[14] 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125
[25] 126 127 128 129 130
```

Infobox
The colon operator (:) returns every integer between two integers. It is an easy way to create a sequence of numbers.

If you type an incomplete command and press Enter, R will display a + prompt, which means R is waiting for you to type the rest of your command. Either finish the command or hit Escape to start over:

```
> 5 -
+
+ 1
[1] 4
```

If you type a command that R doesn’t recognize, R will return an error message. If you ever see an error message, don’t panic. R is just telling you that your computer couldn’t understand or do what you asked it to do. You can then try a different command at the next prompt:

```
> 3 % 5
Error: unexpected input in "3 % 5"
>
```

Once you get the hang of the command line, you can easily do anything in R that you would do with a calculator. For example, you could do some basic arithmetic:

```
2 * 3   
## 6

4 - 1   
## 3

6 / (4 - 1)   
## 2
```

Did you notice something different about this code? I’ve left out the >’s and [1]’s. This will make the code easier to copy and paste if you want to put it in your own console.

R treats the hashtag character, #, in a special way; R will not run anything that follows a hashtag on a line. This makes hashtags very useful for adding comments and annotations to your code. Humans will be able to read the comments, but your computer will pass over them. The hashtag is known as the commenting symbol in R.

For the remainder of the book, I’ll use hashtags to display the output of R code. I’ll use a single hashtag to add my own comments and a double hashtag, ##, to display the results of code. I’ll avoid showing >s and [1]s unless I want you to look at them.

Info Box
Cancelling commands

Some R commands may take a long time to run. You can cancel a command once it has begun by pressing ctrl + c. Note that it may also take R a long time to cancel the comma

Throughout the book, I’ll put exercises in chunks, like the one above. I’ll follow each exercise with a model answer, like the one below.

R is case-sensitive, so name and Name will refer to different objects:
```
Name <- 1
name <- 0

Name + 1
## 2
```
You can name an object in R almost anything you want, but there are a few rules. First, a name cannot start with a number. Second, a name cannot use some special symbols, like ^, !, $, @, +, -, /, or *:

Finally, R will overwrite any previous information stored in an object without asking you for permission. So, it is a good idea to not use names that are already taken:

### Functions

Example
Own function
Arguments

### Task
Economic order quantitiy

$$Q = \sqrt{\frac{2DK}{h}}$$

Calulate the Q where:

$D = 1000$
$K = 5$
$h = 0.25$


```
# get your current working directory
getwd()
[1] "/Users/bradleyboehmke/Dropbox/Academia/Wake Forest/BAN6003"

# set your working directory
setwd("/Users/bradleyboehmke/Dropbox/Academia/Wake Forest")

getwd()
[1] "/Users/bradleyboehmke/Dropbox/Academia/Wake Forest"
```
### Packages

Installing Packages

```r
# install package from CRAN
install.packages("dplyr")   
```
Loading packages

```r
# load the package to use in the current R session
library("packagename")         

# use a particular function within a package without loading the package
packagename::functionname   
```

<!-- Conventions about R Code in the book -->
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

The previous section showed you a couple of examples of running R code. Code in the book looks like this:

```
1 + 2
## [1] 3
```

If you run the same code in your local console, it will look like this:
``` 
> 1 + 2
[1] 3
```

There are two main differences. In your console, you type after the `>`, called the __prompt__; we don't show the prompt in the book. In the book, output is commented out with `#>`; in your console it appears directly after your code. These two differences mean that if you're working with an electronic version of the book, you can easily copy code out of the book and into the console.
Throughout the book we use a consistent set of conventions to refer to code:
* Functions are in a code font and followed by parentheses, like `sum()`, 
  or `mean()`.
* Other R objects (like data or function arguments) are in a code font,
  without parentheses, like `flights` or `x`.
  
* If we want to make it clear what package an object comes from, we'll use
  the package name followed by two colons, like `dplyr::mutate()`, or   
  `nycflights13::flights`. This is also valid R code.

###  `r fa("tasks", fill = "black")` Exercise 1 {-}

1. Identify what working directory you are working out of.
2. Create a folder on your computer titled `datascience`. Within R, set your working directory to this folder.

### Solution {-}

1. Identify what working directory you are working out of.

```r
getwd()
#> [1] "/Users/j.schwarz/NIT/"
```

2. Create a folder on your computer titled `datascience`. Within R, set your working directory to this folder.
```r
setwd("/Users/j.schwarz/NIT/datascience")
```

###  `r fa("tasks", fill = "black")` Task 2

`dplyr` is an extremely popular package for common data transformation activities and is available from CRAN.  Perform the following tasks:

1. Install the `dplyr` package.
2. Load the `dplyr` package.
3. Access the help documentation for the `dplyr` package.
4. Check out the vignette(s) for `dplyr`

### Solution {-}

1. Install the `tidyverse` package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

2. Load the `tidyverse` package.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
