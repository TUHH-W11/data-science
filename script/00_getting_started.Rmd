R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. On the following sites you'll find information about how to install the language R and the IDE RStudio.

The term “R” is used to refer to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it.

RStudio is currently a very popular way to not only write your R scripts but also to interact with the R software. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

## Working with RStudio

Let’s start by learning about RStudio, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.

The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3. The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email support from RStudio, Inc.

We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.

### Understanding the RStudio IDE

```{r rstudio-ide, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Project structure example in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('input/00_getting_started/01_images/rstudio_ide.png', dpi = NA)
```

RStudio interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source, Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer, Console.

Green:

Script files. Saves your code,

Red:

Console/Command Line. Does not save your code. Displays output.

Blue:

Workspace environment. Holds your objects. You can review history

Brown: 

Misc Displays. files in wd. plots when produced. Help files. Loaded packages.

RStudio is divided into 4 “Panes”: the Source for your scripts and documents (top-left, in the default layout), your Environment/History (top-right), your Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (bottom-right), and the R Console (bottom-left). The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout).

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and less error-prone.

```

### Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder, called the working directory. All of the scripts within this folder can then use relative paths to files that indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still work.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its “Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optionally preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a break. Go through the steps for creating an “R Project” for this tutorial below.

Start RStudio.
Under the File menu, click on New Project. Choose New Directory, then New Project.
Enter a name for this new folder (or “directory”), and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your working directory for the rest of the day (e.g., ~/data-carpentry).
Click on Create Project.
Download the code handout, place it in your working directory and rename it (e.g., data-carpentry-script.R).
(Optional) Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in RStudio.
RStudio’s default preferences generally work well, but saving a workspace to .RData can be cumbersome, especially if you are working with larger datasets. To turn that off, go to Tools –> ‘Global Options’ and select the ‘Never’ option for ‘Save workspace to .RData’ on exit.’

Set ‘Save workspace to .RData on exit’ to ‘Never’

#### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for scripts, data, and documents.

data_raw/ & data/ Use these folders to store raw data and intermediate datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake of transparency and provenance, you should always keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could have files data_raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt and ...plot2.txt kept separate from a data/tree.survey.csv file generated by the scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R script.
documents/ This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and other text.
scripts/ This would be the location to keep your R scripts for different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your functions (more on that later).
Additional (sub)directories depending on your project needs.
For this workshop, we will need a data_raw/ folder to store our raw data, and we will use data/ for when we learn how to export data as CSV files, and a fig/ folder for the figures that we will save.

Under the Files tab on the right of the screen, click on New Folder and create a folder named data_raw within your newly created working directory (e.g., ~/data-carpentry/). (Alternatively, type dir.create("data_raw") at your R console.) Repeat these operations to create a data and a fig folder.
We are going to keep the script in the root of our working directory because we are only going to use one file and it will make things easier.

Your working directory should now look like this:

#### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When you write code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to the root of your working directory and only need files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory is set properly. If you need to check it, you can use getwd(). If for some reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser where your working directory should be, and clicking on the blue gear icon “More”, and select “Set As Working Directory”. Alternatively you can use setwd("/path/to/working/directory") to reset your working directory. However, your scripts should not include this line because it will fail on someone else’s computer.

#### Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or code, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call the instructions commands and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by executing (also called running) those commands.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console and press Enter to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.

Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their computer.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the Ctrl + Enter shortcut (on Macs, Cmd + Return will work, too). The command on the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press Ctrl + Enter. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE.

At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of a variable or the structure of an object, without necessarily keeping a record of it in your script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the console. RStudio provides the Ctrl + 1 and Ctrl + 2 shortcuts allow you to jump between the script and the console panes.

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>), R will try to execute it, and when ready, will show the results and come back with a new `>` prompt to wait for new commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn't complete yet, the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you haven't finished entering a complete command. This is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and press <kbd>`Esc`</kbd>; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.

#### Tasks


Installing Packages

```r
# install package from CRAN
install.packages("dplyr")   
```
Loading packages

```r
# load the package to use in the current R session
library("packagename")         

# use a particular function within a package without loading the package
packagename::functionname   
```

<!-- Conventions about R Code in the book -->
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
##  `r fa("info", fill = "black")` Basic R commands and syntax (stolen from R4DS)
The previous section showed you a couple of examples of running R code. Code in the book looks like this:

```
1 + 2
## [1] 3
```

If you run the same code in your local console, it will look like this:
``` 
> 1 + 2
[1] 3
```

There are two main differences. In your console, you type after the `>`, called the __prompt__; we don't show the prompt in the book. In the book, output is commented out with `#>`; in your console it appears directly after your code. These two differences mean that if you're working with an electronic version of the book, you can easily copy code out of the book and into the console.
Throughout the book we use a consistent set of conventions to refer to code:
* Functions are in a code font and followed by parentheses, like `sum()`, 
  or `mean()`.
* Other R objects (like data or function arguments) are in a code font,
  without parentheses, like `flights` or `x`.
  
* If we want to make it clear what package an object comes from, we'll use
  the package name followed by two colons, like `dplyr::mutate()`, or   
  `nycflights13::flights`. This is also valid R code.
