# Welcome {-}

This script are the class notes used in the NIT Data Science course. It will teach you how to program in R, with hands-on examples for business analytics. It is written for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. You’ll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R’s programming tools.
