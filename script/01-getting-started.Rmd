# Getting started with R and RStudio {#intro}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

## Working with RStudio

### Console

### Script Editor

### Workspace Environment

### Misc. Displays

### Exercise

1. Identify what working directory you are working out of.
2. Create a folder on your computer titled Learning R. Within R, set your working directory to this folder.

## Working with Packages

### Installing Packages

```r
# install package from CRAN
install.packages("dplyr")   
```

### Loading packages

```r
# load the package to use in the current R session
library("packagename")         

# use a particular function within a package without loading the package
packagename::functionname    
```

### Exercise

`dplyr` is an extremely popular package for common data transformation activities and is available from CRAN.  Perform the following tasks:

1. Install the `dplyr` package.
2. Load the `dplyr` package.
3. Access the help documentation for the `dplyr` package.
4. Check out the vignette(s) for `dplyr`
